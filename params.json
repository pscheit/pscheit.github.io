{"name":"Hi, I'm Philipp","tagline":"","body":"# about me\r\n\r\nHi, I'm Philipp. I like PHP and Javascript and everything around web-software. I'm head developer of the webforge framework (@webforge-labs) and own a [small company with the same name](http://www.ps-webforge.com/).\r\nI think about coding as a craft, theoretical patterns, algorithms and domain models. But as much as I love talking about code, I write a lot of code. Feel free to checkout my projects @pscheit and whenever you feel something is very useful for you, give me feedback. I'm always interested in collaborating and meeting new people.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
